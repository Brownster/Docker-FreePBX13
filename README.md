# Docker-FreePBX13
Docker | Freepbx 13

This is a Docker file to build a Asterisk 13.1 and FreePBX 13 container, with XML for unraid 6 installs.

Not had chance to try this out yet but should be pretty close to building, will be a few weeks before i get chance to do anything else with this.

Just really need to confirm what packages are really needed now.
